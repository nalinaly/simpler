/**
 * Scheduler — DAG scheduling engine.
 *
 * The Scheduler thread routes tasks through the DAG lifecycle:
 *   ready_queue → dispatch (via WorkerManager) → completion → fanout release → new ready
 *
 * Worker endpoint ownership and dispatch are delegated to WorkerManager.
 * NEXT_LEVEL placement is fixed at submit; SUB remains free.
 *
 * Flow:
 *   Orch: submit() → directed NEXT_LEVEL queue or shared SUB queue + notify
 *
 *   Scheduler thread:
 *     wait on cv while no endpoint is active
 *     poll every active endpoint through WorkerManager
 *     drain completion_queue → on_task_complete → fanout release → ready_queue
 *     launch directed NEXT_LEVEL tasks, then freely scheduled SUB tasks
 *
 * The idle wait is edge-triggered, so any state change that turns already-
 * queued work into placeable work must advance the wake generation. Active
 * endpoints keep the loop running until all endpoint-owned work terminalizes.

/**
 * Take ownership of a READY slot for dispatch, atomically.
 *
 * Reading READY and later storing RUNNING are not the same thing. A run whose
 * graph callback throws fails its own unstarted slots and consumes them, and
 * its fence can then release the run's pipeline lease — all while the scheduler
 * sits between those two points picking workers. A plain store would overwrite
 * that cancelled state and dispatch a task whose run is already terminal and
 * whose slot may have been reused. A failed claim means the slot is no longer
 * ours: whoever moved it out of READY owns its consume.
 *
 * Call this at the point of dispatch, after every other admission check — the
 * window this closes is exactly the code between the queue pop and the launch.
