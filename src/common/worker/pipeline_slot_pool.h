/**
 * Replay filter for a consumer that executes leases minted elsewhere.
 *
 * `PipelineSlotPool` is the sole mint and the sole authority on who owns a
 * slot. A consumer downstream of it never sees an acquire or a release, so it
 * cannot re-derive ownership; it records the newest generation each slot has
 * presented and refuses anything older. Repeating the current generation stays
 * admissible, because one run may dispatch several times under one lease.
 *
 * This is strictly weaker than an ownership check, and deliberately so. It
 * rejects a *superseded* lease — one whose successor has already presented
 * itself — but a lease that was released while its successor has not yet
 * reached this consumer still passes, because nothing has raised the mark.
 * Closing that window requires gating dispatch on `PipelineSlotPool::owns`
 * before work is handed down, which belongs to whoever admits runs.
 *
 * The filter mints nothing. A consumer that also served unleased work must not
 * invent generations for it, or a later real lease is rejected as stale.
