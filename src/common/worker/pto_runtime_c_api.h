/**
 * simpler host-runtime C API — canonical header
 *
 * Declares all C-linkage functions exported by the host runtime .so.
 * Both the ChipWorker (consumer, resolves public symbols via dlsym) and the
 * platform implementations (producers, define all symbols) include this file.
 *
 * Required API — resolved by ChipWorker via dlsym (every host_runtime.so must
 * export all of these; runtimes without a real backend ship not-supported
 * stubs rather than omitting symbols):
 *   - lifecycle:    create_device_context, destroy_device_context,
 *                   simpler_init, finalize_device
 *   - sizing:       get_runtime_size, get_runtime_alignment
 *   - device-mem:   device_malloc_ctx, device_free_ctx,
 *                   committed_device_memory_ctx,
 *                   copy_to_device_ctx, copy_from_device_ctx
 *   - prepared run: simpler_register_callable, simpler_prepare_run,
 *                   simpler_launch_run, simpler_poll_run, simpler_wait_run,
 *                   simpler_finalize_run, simpler_run,
 *                   simpler_unregister_callable,
 *                   get_aicpu_dlopen_count, get_host_dlopen_count,
 *                   get_run_stream_set_create_count,
 *                   simpler_provision_dma_workspace
 *   - pipeline:     get_pipeline_contract,
 *                   supports_concurrent_native_prepare_ctx,
 *                   get_arena_bank_gm_heap_base_ctx,
 *                   get_retained_temp_addr_ctx
 *   - ACL/stream:   ensure_acl_ready_ctx, create_comm_stream_ctx,
 *                   destroy_comm_stream_ctx
 *   - comm:         comm_init, comm_alloc_windows, comm_get_local_window_base,
 *                   comm_get_window_size, comm_barrier, comm_destroy
 *
 * Native-run storage: caller allocates at least get_runtime_size() bytes with
 * get_runtime_alignment() alignment, zero-initializes it before first use, and
 * keeps its address stable from prepare through finalize. After finalize the
 * same storage may be reused without re-zeroing. The storage must not be moved,
 * copied, or used for overlapping runs while it contains a prepared run. The
 * caller must serialize phase functions for a given context/storage pair;
 * poll/wait/finalize are not concurrent operations on the same run.
 * Error codes: 0 = success, negative = error.

 *      log session's level at context-open time (rtSetDevice); a later
 *      dlog_setlevel would not re-level the already-opened device session.
 *      The log level itself is owned by libsimpler_log.so (seeded earlier
 *      by simpler_log_init); it never travels through this ABI.
 *
 *   2. Attach the calling thread to `device_id` (rtSetDevice on onboard,
 *      pto_cpu_sim_bind_device + pto_cpu_sim_acquire_device on sim) and
 *      record the device id on the DeviceRunner so subsequent device-ops
 *      can re-attach their own caller threads idempotently.
 *
 *   3. Take ownership of the AICPU + AICore executor binaries (copied into
 *      DeviceRunner-owned vectors). All subsequent simpler_register_callable /
 *      simpler_run invocations reuse this resident pair — no binary bytes
 *      cross the C ABI on per-run paths.
 *
 *   4. When `prewarm_config` is non-null, build + upload + cache the prebuilt
 *      runtime-arena for its `runtime_env` ring sizing (tensormap_and_ringbuffer;
 *      a no-op for runtimes without a prebuilt arena). The device is up by this
