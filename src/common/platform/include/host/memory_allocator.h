/**
 * @file memory_allocator.h
 * @brief Memory Allocator - Centralized Memory Management
 *
 * This module provides centralized management of memory allocations with
 * automatic tracking and cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
 *
 * Platform Support (same shape for both arches):
 * - onboard: Device memory management using CANN runtime API (rtMalloc/rtFree)
 * - sim: Host memory management using standard malloc/free
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Automatic tracking of all allocated memory
 * - Safe deallocation with existence checking
 * - Automatic cleanup via destructor (RAII pattern)
 * - Idempotent finalize() for explicit cleanup with error checking
