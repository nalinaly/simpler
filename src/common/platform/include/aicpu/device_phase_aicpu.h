/**
 * @file device_phase_aicpu.h
 * @brief AICPU-side stamping into the fixed device-phase buffer.
 *
 * The buffer (header + AicpuPhaseRecord[NUM_AICPU_PHASES] per AICPU thread +
 * optional task-timing tail) is host-allocated; its base address is published
 * into the AICPU SO via
 * `set_platform_phase_base()` (onboard: kernel.cpp from KernelArgs; sim: the
 * host dlsym's the setter), exactly like the dump / chip_swimlane / pmu bases.
 * The per-thread slot is resolved from `platform_aicpu_affinity_thread_idx()`
 * (POSIX pthread-key TLS) — no C++ `thread_local`, per docs/dynamic-linking.md,
 * so the base survives the dlopen boundary on sim.
 *
 * Each surviving thread stamps its OWN slot with raw get_sys_cnt_aicpu() cycles
 * — plain stores, no atomics, no rotation (each fixed phase fires once per run).
 * The host reduces across threads on readback (see read_device_wall_ns).
 *
 * All helpers are no-ops when the base is unset (capture disabled) or the
 * thread slot is out of range, so call sites need no extra guards.
