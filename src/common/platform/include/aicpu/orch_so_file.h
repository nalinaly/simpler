/**
 * @file orch_so_file.h
 * @brief Orchestration SO File Creation Interface for AICPU
 *
 * Creates a writable, executable-mode file under a candidate directory for
 * staging the device orchestration shared library prior to dlopen.
 *
 * Platform Support (same shape for both arches):
 * - onboard: pid-based naming via open() with mode 0755. AICPU device libc
 *   may not provide mkstemps, and only one runtime runs per device process.
 * - sim: mkstemps() with fchmod(0755). Multiple sim workers can share a
 *   process, so names must be unique per call.

/**
 * Create a unique orchestration SO file under `dir`.
 *
 * On success, writes the full chosen path into `out_path` (null-terminated)
 * and returns an open writable fd (caller must close). Permissions are set
 * so the file is executable (0755) and suitable for dlopen.
 *
 * On failure (path too long, directory not writable, etc.), returns -1.
 * Caller is expected to try the next candidate directory.
 *
 * @param dir            Candidate directory (e.g. "/tmp")
 * @param callable_id    Per-callable_id table slot id (>= 0). Required for
 *                       uniqueness on the onboard path so concurrently-
 *                       resident orch SOs (one per cid) do not collide on
 *                       the same on-disk file. Pass -1 for the legacy
 *                       single-slot dispatch path.
 * @param device_id      ACL device ordinal, suffixed onto the onboard name so
 *                       the paired dies of one chip (which share this preinstall
 *                       filesystem) never stage/execute the same on-disk file.
 * @param out_path       Buffer that receives the full file path on success
 * @param out_path_size  Size of `out_path` in bytes
 * @return Open writable fd on success, -1 on failure
