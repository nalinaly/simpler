/**
 * Translate an ACL/rt *logical* device id into the *driver-visible* id that the
 * raw driver HAL indexes.
 *
 * Contract — every device id crossing into the driver must pick the right space:
 *   - Direct `hal*` / `dlsym`'d driver calls (`halMemCtl`, `halGetDeviceInfo*`,
 *     ...) index the driver-visible space and MUST translate through this
 *     function: `hal_fn(acl_to_hal_device_id(device_id))`.
 *   - ACL/rt entry points (`aclrtSetDevice`, `rtMalloc`, `rtMemcpy`, stream
 *     APIs, ...) take the logical id and MUST NOT.
 *
 * `ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES` renumbers the logical space to `0..N-1` while the
 * HAL keeps indexing the driver-visible space; a direct HAL call made with the
 * logical id then targets the wrong device (`rc=42`). This returns the identity
 * when the variable is unset (legacy / no isolation).
 *
 * The whole list is validated before any entry is trusted: one malformed token
 * means the environment is misconfigured, so we fall back to the unremapped
 * logical id rather than act on a half-parsed guess. Every fallback is logged so
 * a silent mis-target becomes a two-second diagnosis.
 *
 * Note: the returned value is the *driver-visible* id, which need not equal the
 * absolute physical (`npu-smi`) id — a container-level `ASCEND_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
 * remaps the driver's own numbering, and `ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES` indexes
 * into that already-remapped set. Indexing the driver-visible set is exactly
 * what the HAL needs.
