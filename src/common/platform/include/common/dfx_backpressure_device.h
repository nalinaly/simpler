/**
 * @file dfx_backpressure_device.h
 * @brief Unified DFX backpressure (block-on-contention + global-sync freeze)
 *        coordination — shared layout + AICPU-side primitives.
 *
 * `DfxBackpressureHeader` is the per-subsystem coordination block. Every DFX
 * subsystem's DataHeader embeds ONE `DfxBackpressureHeader backpressure;` member
 * instead of re-declaring the three fields. It is physically per-subsystem (each
 * subsystem has its own shared-memory region) — that is the per-subsystem peer
 * group: swimlane's freeze is independent of pmu's. The struct *definition* is
 * shared here; the *instances* are necessarily separate.
 *
 * The two device-side reactions (park at the gate / raise the leader signal)
 * live here too. The host side of the mechanism (the freeze open/release state
 * machine) lives once in `ProfilerAlgorithms::update_backpressure_freeze`
 * (host/profiler_base.h). Every DFX subsystem carries the header block and runs
 * the machinery; block-on-contention is the only behavior — it is idle at zero
 * cost until a lane raises `contended`.

// SPIN_WAIT_HINT() is the repo-wide AICPU spin-wait relax used by every
// resource-wait spin (ring/dep-pool full, lock_fanout ticket locks, scheduler
// dispatch). It is platform-tiered: onboard silicon expands to a no-op (AICPU
// owns its A55 core), sim adds sched_yield() so the oversubscribed host cores
// don't starve the AICore threads running real kernels.
//
// This header must NEVER (re)define SPIN_WAIT_HINT once a translation unit
// already has it. It is pulled — via each DFX DataHeader — into always-on
// scheduler / orchestrator / aicore TUs that already got the platform's
// sched_yield() definition (from inner_kernel.h / pto_runtime2_types.h). An
// unguarded `#define SPIN_WAIT_HINT() ((void)0)` here would clobber that on
// include order, turning those TUs' yielding spins into busy spins and starving
// the AICore threads (sim scheduler no-progress timeout). So: reuse whatever the
// platform already provides; only supply the fallback — for pure host,
// struct-only builds where spin_hint.h is off the path and the spin templates
// are never instantiated — when nobody else has defined it.
