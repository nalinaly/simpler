/**
 * @file host_tensor_access.h
 * @brief Tensor-byte access for the host orchestrator, over device buffers.
 *
 * `Tensor::buffer.addr` is a device address. host_build_graph runs the
 * orchestrator on the host, so `get_tensor_data` / `set_tensor_data` cannot
 * assume the CPU executing them can load that address — whether it can is a
 * platform capability, not a property of the runtime. This is the seam where
 * that capability is resolved, so the orchestrator core never dereferences a
 * device address itself.
 *
 * A region is registered per staged tensor with the host address serving it:
 *
 *   - `host_view == dev_base`  — the device buffer is mapped into the host
 *     address space (a2a3 `halHostRegister(DEV_SVM_MAP_HOST)`; sim, where a
 *     device pointer is already a host pointer). Reads and writes land on the
 *     device bytes directly.
 *   - `host_view != dev_base`  — no host mapping exists. The region is served
 *     from the staging buffer holding the same bytes, and a write is pushed
 *     back through the device-copy hook so the device observes it.
 *
 * An address no registered region covers is a failure, never a raw
 * dereference: only tensors the runtime staged have a host view at all, so a
 * GM-heap tensor or a pass-through child-memory buffer resolves to nothing.
 *
 * Registrations are valid only for one orchestration run — the window between
 * staging and the first dispatched task. A mirror is a copy, and nothing has
 * executed yet to make it stale; once tasks run, a stale mirror would be
 * indistinguishable from live device memory. `host_tensor_access_reset` bounds
 * that window at both ends.
 *
 * The read/write pair carries weak fallbacks in the runtime translation unit
 * (`orchestrator_core/pto_runtime2.cpp`) that dereference `dev_addr` directly,
 * so the AICPU build — which compiles this path but never runs an
 * orchestrator — resolves without this .cpp. libhost_runtime.so links the
 * strong definitions from `host/host_tensor_access.cpp`.
