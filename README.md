# simpler — Simple Runtime

**Make writing runtime simpler.**

Modular runtime for building and executing task dependency graphs on Ascend devices with coordinated AICPU and AICore execution. Three independently compiled programs (Host `.so`, AICPU `.so`, AICore `.o`) work together through clearly defined APIs.

## Where simpler sits in the stack

simpler is one layer of the [hw-native-sys](https://github.com/hw-native-sys) stack. Each repo below imports the ones to its left:

```text
pto-isa ──▶ simpler ──▶ pypto ──▶ pypto-lib ──▶ pypto-serving
(tile ISA)  (runtime)  (compiler)  (kernels)    (serving)
                ▲
             PTOAS (assembler, installed globally)
```

**simpler owns** task orchestration and dispatch at runtime: DAG submission, the AICPU/host scheduler, worker and device lifecycle, the host↔device handshake, and the DFX/profiling tooling that reads it back. **simpler does not own** kernel bodies, the tile ISA, graph compilation, or model/serving logic — those belong to the repos below.

| Repository | Owns | Relation to simpler |
| ---------- | ---- | ------------------- |
| [pto-isa](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pto-isa) | PTO tile virtual ISA and its C++ tile-instruction library | Build-time dependency: AICore kernels in `examples/` include its headers; revision pinned by [`pto_isa.pin`](pto_isa.pin) |
| [PTOAS](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/PTOAS) | `ptoas` — MLIR-based assembler/optimizer lowering PTO bytecode to device code | Provided as a global binary on dev boxes and CI; simpler neither builds nor vendors it |
| [pypto](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pypto) | Tensor/Tile programming framework and compiler (Python frontend → PTO IR → device code) | Vendors simpler as a submodule at `runtime/` and drives it through simpler's Python API |
| [pypto-lib](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pypto-lib) | Tensor-level kernels and end-to-end model implementations (Qwen3, DeepSeek) | Consumer of pypto + simpler; source of the cross-repo performance and regression workloads |
| [pypto-serving](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pypto-serving) | LLM inference service and standalone model runners | Top of the stack — exercises simpler through the full serving path |
| [pypto_top_level_documents](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/pypto_top_level_documents) | Cross-repo design documents and proposals | Where runtime designs spanning more than one repo are written down |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd simpler

# Install (venv recommended — see `.claude/rules/venv-isolation.md`)
pip install --no-build-isolation -e '.[test]'

# Run the vector example (simulation, no hardware required)
python examples/a2a3/tensormap_and_ringbuffer/vector_example/test_vector_example.py -p a2a3sim
```

PTO ISA headers are automatically cloned on first run. See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for manual setup and troubleshooting.

## Platforms

| Platform | Description | Requirements |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| `a2a3` | Real Ascend A2/A3 hardware | CANN toolkit (ccec, aarch64 cross-compiler) |
| `a2a3sim` | Thread-based A2/A3 simulation | gcc/g++ only (no Ascend SDK needed) |
| `a5` | Real Ascend A5 hardware | CANN toolkit (ccec, aarch64 cross-compiler) |
| `a5sim` | Thread-based A5 simulation | gcc/g++ only (no Ascend SDK needed) |

## Runtime Variants

Two runtimes under `src/{arch}/runtime/`, each with a different graph-building strategy:

| Runtime | Graph built on | Use case |
| ------- | -------------- | -------- |
| `host_build_graph` | Host CPU | Development, debugging |
| `tensormap_and_ringbuffer` | AICPU (device) | Production workloads |

See runtime docs per arch: [a2a3](src/a2a3/docs/runtimes.md), [a5](src/a5/docs/runtimes.md).

## Testing

```bash
# Simulation scene tests (no hardware)
pytest examples tests/st --platform a2a3sim

# Hardware scene tests (requires Ascend device)
# SDMA cases are quarantined by marker, as in CI; run them separately with -m sdma
pytest examples tests/st -m "not sdma" --platform a2a3 --device 4-7

# Python unit tests
pytest tests/ut -m "not requires_hardware" -v

# C++ unit tests
cmake -B tests/ut/cpp/build -S tests/ut/cpp && cmake --build tests/ut/cpp/build && ctest --test-dir tests/ut/cpp/build --output-on-failure
```

See [Testing Guide](docs/testing.md) for details.

## Environment Setup

```bash
source /usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest/bin/setenv.bash
export ASCEND_HOME_PATH=/usr/local/Ascend/ascend-toolkit/latest
```
