"""Device-free chip-backed Worker trees for the Python worker unit tests.

A chip child is forked, so the ``ChipWorker`` bound on ``simpler.worker`` at
``Worker.init()`` time is the class the forked child instantiates. Replacing it
with :class:`FakeChipWorker` yields an L3 that carries ``device_ids``, reaches
READY, serves the CTRL_REGISTER / CTRL_UNREGISTER control path, and closes —
with no NPU and no device runtime driven. ``platform="a2a3sim"`` is a
construction-time requirement only: the parent reads the prebuilt sim runtime
binaries to build the fork payload and never executes them, which is what
:data:`requires_sim_binaries` gates on.

A fake chip is the real dispatch target for its L3, so a broadcast that reaches
it is observable from the parent: ``register_error`` makes the chip child's
native register raise, and the failure surfaces to the caller of
``Worker.register`` as REGISTER_PARTIAL_FAILURE.
