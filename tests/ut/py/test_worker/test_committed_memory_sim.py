"""Sim-backend test for ``Worker.committed_device_memory()`` (level 2).

Exercises the full Python -> ChipWorker -> dlsym'd
``committed_device_memory_ctx`` -> SimDeviceRunnerBase -> MemoryAllocator stack
on the sim backend (no real hardware). Asserts the reported bytes rise after a
device malloc and fall after the matching free.
