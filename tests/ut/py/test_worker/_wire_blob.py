"""Encode a task-args blob from Python, for tests that exercise a receive path directly.

Production never encodes one here: `write_blob` in `task_args.h` is the only writer, and the bound
wire types expose their fields but not their bytes, which is what keeps `validate_tensor` the single
gate on the way in. A test that wants to hand `ImportRegistry` a blob therefore has to lay the bytes
out itself.

That is a feature rather than a workaround. These formats are written from the `static_assert`s in
`src/common/task_interface/buffer.h` and the layout comment in `task_args.h`, independently of the
C++ that reads them, so a layout change that updates only one side fails here instead of passing by
construction — which is exactly what a `pack()` on the bound type could not do.
