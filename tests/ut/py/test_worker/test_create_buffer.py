"""Owner-side ``Worker.create_buffer``: the child-topology gate and the identity it mints.

``_create_buffer_locked`` reads only ``level``, the three child-shm lists, and the buffer registry
state, so these run against a Worker built with ``__new__`` — no fork, no device, no ``init()``.
The gate is the point: an L3+ backing is resolved by a forked child mapping the shm by name, and
**every** kind of forked child can do that, so counting only chip and sub children refuses an L4
whose children are local L3 Workers.
