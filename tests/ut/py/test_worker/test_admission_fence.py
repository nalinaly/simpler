"""Admission fencing for register / unregister, and the one-way shutdown word.

``Worker.close()`` publishes CLOSED and then drains ``_active_ops`` before it
touches the tree, so every API that mutates the registry or drives a child must
hold an ``_operation_lease`` for its WHOLE transaction — publication included.
A registry mutation made outside the lease is invisible to that drain, which is
how a registration lands on a worker whose teardown is already running.

Termination has the mirror-image problem on the wire: the mailbox state word has
three writers, and the ``CONTROL_DONE`` a child publishes for an in-flight
control command overwrites a concurrent ``SHUTDOWN`` store, leaving the child
polling a mailbox whose request has been erased. The sticky ``_OFF_SHUTDOWN``
word is written only by a terminating parent and never cleared, so it survives
that overwrite.

Every test here is device-free. Live-tree races use an L3 worker with one SUB
child; lifecycle crossover cases use inert L2/L3/L4 workers. A module-wide hard
timeout turns any reintroduced unbounded wait into a prompt failure.
