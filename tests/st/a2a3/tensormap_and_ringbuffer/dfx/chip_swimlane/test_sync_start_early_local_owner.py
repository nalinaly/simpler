"""Regression for #1548: an early sync-start cohort fits one scheduler.

The idle cases use a slow flagged AIC producer and exercise both one and three
scheduler threads. The dependent AIV sync-start consumer fits one owner's local
tracker and must not stop its peers.

The pending case instead keeps every AIV core busy with a blocker. A
pre-submit scheduler-loop fence retires all blocker ACKs. A second fence after
consumer submission completes only after an early-dispatch opportunity while
the measured one-second hold keeps every running slot occupied. Phase capture
verifies all eight blocks staged locally.

The phase assertion runs only with chip swimlane level >= 3. The ordinary scene
test still checks workload correctness when diagnostics are disabled.
