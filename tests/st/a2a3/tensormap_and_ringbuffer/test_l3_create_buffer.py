"""L3 create_buffer owner-side allocation (P1-B).

``Worker.create_buffer`` allocates a born-shared Buffer carrying a typed canonical identity.
There is **no eager export handshake**: the handle's self-describing descriptor rides embedded in
every Tensor built over it, and a consumer materializes it lazily on first receipt. This test
covers the owner-side contract — a live L3 Worker allocates handles that carry a stable identity, a
monotonic buffer_id, and usable born-shared backing, and releases them cleanly on close.

a2a3sim: create_buffer is pure host-side (POSIX shm), no platform branching. The vector callable
exists only to give the L3 worker a chip child to fork (create_buffer requires one).
