"""SPMD sync_start stress: 54 tasks over 6 rounds with mixed shapes (MIX + AIV).

The four cohort widths scale with the run's cluster count and are reported back
in `layout` — a run always takes the whole device, and that width differs
between sim and silicon. The host replays the same round structure from the
reported widths; `output` is sized for the widest device the platform allows.
