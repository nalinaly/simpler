"""Onboard ST: chip init works when ``ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` renumbers the device.

A launcher that isolates NPUs (task queue, container plugin, vLLM-ascend-style
worker-per-card) sets ``ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` and then hands simpler
logical ids starting at 0. ACL honors the variable for its own entry points, but
the chip-init path also makes **direct driver calls that bypass ACL** —
``halMemCtl`` / ``halGetDeviceInfo*`` on a2a3, ``halResMap`` /
``halGetDeviceInfo*`` / ``dsmi_get_device_info`` on a5 — and those index the
driver-visible space. Every one of them must translate through
``common/acl_hal_device.h::acl_to_hal_device_id``; a site that forgets targets
the wrong device and fails with ``halMemCtl rc=42`` in
``init_aicore_register_addresses``.

``init_aicore_register_addresses`` and ``probe_aicpu_topology`` run on every
onboard chip bring-up, so *any* scene test launched under the variable covers
all of those call sites. ``dummy_task`` is the cheapest one.

The scene test runs in a subprocess: the variable has to be set before the
process performing ACL init starts, and mutating it in-process would leak into
the pooled workers the rest of the session shares.
