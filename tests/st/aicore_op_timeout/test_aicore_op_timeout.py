"""Negative ST for the AICore op-execution timeout chain (regression for PR #718).

Hardware-only: dispatches an AIC kernel that spins forever. This test pins
the CI-tight timeout chain (AICPU scheduler 2 s, STARS op watchdog 3 s,
host stream sync 4 s) so the hang surfaces in single-digit seconds rather
than deadlocking. Sim variants are excluded
because the simulator has no STARS watchdog — a ``while(true)`` kernel
would wedge the sim.
