"""Wide host-build-graph dispatch: AIV cohort plus sync-start and normal MIX placement.

Sizes every cohort from ``rt_available_cluster_count`` / ``rt_available_aiv_count``, so
coverage follows the device the case runs on. On the sim platforms this file is marked
for, that is ``SIM_AUTO_BLOCKDIM`` (8) clusters — 24 core-state bits, entirely within the
low 64 of ``CoreTracker::BitStates``. **This case therefore does not reach a cluster
offset above bit 63**; the >63-bit MIX selection path is covered by the arch-parity unit
test ``tests/ut/cpp/common/test_hbg_core_tracker.cpp``, which drives ``CoreTracker``
directly at ``MAX_CLUSTERS``. What this case does cover is that MIX placement, sync-start
drain, and the AIV cohort agree on block-to-core mapping when a single scheduler thread
(``aicpu_thread_num=2`` leaves one scheduler plus one resolution thread) owns every cluster.
