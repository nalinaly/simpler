"""A wide flagged producer feeds a MIX sync_start early-dispatch consumer (a5).

Cases EarlyOn / EarlyOff toggle producer ``allow_early_resolve`` via orch scalar
so swimlanes can be compared under identical topology.

The consumer cohort is exactly this run's cluster count: it must occupy every AIC
slot, and require_sync_start needs every block of it co-resident. The
orchestration reports the width it used and the golden is rebuilt from it. The
producer stays wider than the device on purpose — it carries no sync_start.
