"""Regression for #1548: an a5 early sync-start cohort fits one scheduler.

Idle-capacity cases run with one and three schedulers, using a cohort sized to
fit any local owner in that topology. A pending-capacity case fills every AIV
running slot first, forcing the local owner to stage the eight-block consumer
entirely into free pending slots. A scheduler-loop fence makes the setup
deterministic; a second fence keeps the blockers running through the consumer's
early-dispatch opportunity during their measured one-second hold. Phase capture
then verifies all eight local stages.
