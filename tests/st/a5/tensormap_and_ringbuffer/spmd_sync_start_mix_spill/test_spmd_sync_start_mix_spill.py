"""sync_start MIX per-core pending-spill on a5.

A flagged AIV producer occupies every AIV core and spins; the require_sync_start
MIX consumer, one block per cluster, pre-stages with AIC on idle running slots and
AIVs on busy pending slots. EarlyOn / EarlyOff toggle producer
``allow_early_resolve``.

The producer spans every AIV core and the consumer every cluster, so both
widths are the device's own counts — a run always takes the whole device, and
that width differs between sim and silicon. The orchestration reports the two
widths in `layout` and the golden is rebuilt from them.
