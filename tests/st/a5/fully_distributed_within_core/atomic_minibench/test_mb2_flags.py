"""MB-2 flags[] cacheline clobber — concurrent flag set on shared cache lines.

Submits N independent write-only tasks (no cross-task dependencies). Each task
writes its index into a distinct slot of a single output tensor. Completion
flags are densely packed (16 int32 flags per 64B cache line), so concurrent
flag-set by different cores maximises cacheline-clobber pressure.

On A5 onboard (no HW cache coherence), the buggy path (plain store + dcci
CACHELINE_OUT) clobbers neighbouring flags → some tasks never observed as
complete → golden fails (missing writes) or hangs. The fixed path
(atomicMax in dist_set_flag) writes the true HBM word directly.

Criteria (docs MB-2):
  - All consumers complete (no hang from lost flags)
  - Golden passes (all slots written — no data corruption)
  - PTO_DIST_DEPSIG=1 signature consistent

Onboard only: sim has no cache-line concept and masks the issue.
