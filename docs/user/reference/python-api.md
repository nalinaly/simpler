# Python API reference

The surface you write against, hand-maintained: what `**config` keys `Worker`
accepts, `CallConfig` defaults, and the argument-order footguns a generator
cannot state. For the complete generated listing of every public symbol and
signature, see the API pages on the
[documentation site](https://hw-native-sys.github.io/simpler/user/reference/api/worker/).
Treat the source as authoritative when the two disagree, and fix this page in the
same change.

`Worker` is available from the package root; the remaining task and callable
types live in `simpler.task_interface`. Both resolve on first access, so
`import simpler` alone stays cheap and does not require the `_task_interface`
extension.

```python
from simpler import Worker           # or: from simpler.worker import Worker
from simpler.task_interface import (
    ArgDirection, CallConfig, ChipCallable, ChipStorageTaskArgs,
    ChipTensor, CoreCallable, DataType,
)
from simpler_setup import KernelCompiler, SceneTestCase, scene_test
```

## `Worker`

```python
Worker(level: int, **config)
```

`level` is the only declared parameter; everything else is a keyword collected
into `**config` and validated later. The recognized keys:

| Key | Applies to | Meaning |
| --- | ---------- | ------- |
| `platform` | all | `a2a3`, `a2a3sim`, `a5`, `a5sim` |
| `runtime` | all | `tensormap_and_ringbuffer` or `host_build_graph` |
| `device_id` | L2 | the single chip this worker drives |
| `device_ids` | L3+ | one chip child process per entry |
| `num_sub_workers` | L3+ | host-side Python callables to fork |
| `enable_sdma` | a2a3 | provisions the SDMA workspace; defaults to `False` |
| `heap_ring_size` | all | heap ring sizing |
| `remote_heap_ring_size`, `remote_session_timeout_s` | L4 | remote-session sizing and timeout |

`level` selects the topology: `2` is one chip, `>= 3` is hierarchical. Anything
else raises. Remote-worker and remote-memory calls require `level >= 4`.

### Lifecycle

| Method | Notes |
| ------ | ----- |
| `register(target, *, workers=None) -> CallableHandle` | **Before `init()`.** Accepts a `ChipCallable` or, at L3+, a Python callable |
| `unregister(handle_or_slot)` | Releases a registration |
| `add_worker(worker) -> int` | Attaches a child worker; returns its id |
| `add_remote_worker(spec: RemoteWorkerSpec) -> int` | L4; see the remote-L3 design doc |
| `init(prewarm_config=None)` | Resolves runtime binaries, opens the device, forks children. First place setup errors appear |
| `close()` | Releases the device and reaps children. Put it in a `finally` — a skipped `close()` leaves the device held |

### Memory

| Method | Notes |
| ------ | ----- |
| `malloc(size, worker_id=0) -> int` | Returns a device pointer as an integer |
| `free(ptr, worker_id=0)` | |
| `copy_to(dst, src)` | H2D; `dst` is a device `Buffer`, `src` a host `Buffer` from `create_buffer` (at L2, also any torch tensor or writable buffer). `dst` may be a `base + offset` interior handle as long as `[dst, dst + size)` lies within one live allocation (partial update of a persistent buffer) |
| `copy_from(dst, src)` | D2H; `dst` is the host `Buffer` (at L2, also any writable buffer). `src` may be an interior handle whose `[src, src + size)` lies within one live device allocation |
| `create_buffer(nbytes) -> Buffer` / `Buffer.close()` | Shared host backing this Worker owns; build a view over `handle.shm.buf`, name it on the wire with `handle.tensor(shapes, dtype)` |
| `remote_malloc` / `remote_free` / `remote_copy_to` / `remote_copy_from` / `remote_export` / `remote_import` / `remote_release_import` | L4 only |

### Execution

| Method | Notes |
| ------ | ----- |
| `run(callable, args=None, config=None) -> None` | Blocks until the run completes |
| `submit(callable, args=None, config=None) -> RunHandle` | Non-blocking |
| `live_domains() -> dict[str, CommDomainHandle]` | Currently allocated communication domains |

`RunHandle` exposes `done() -> bool`, `wait(timeout=None)`, and
`result(timeout=None)`.

At L2 the `callable` is a registered `ChipCallable` handle. At L3+ the top-level
callable is a **Python orchestration function** `f(orch, args, cfg)`, where
`orch` is the `Orchestrator`:

| Method | Notes |
| ------ | ----- |
| `submit_next_level(callable_handle, args, config=None, *, worker: int)` | Hands a `ChipCallable` to one chip child. `worker` is keyword-only |
| `submit_sub(callable_handle, args=None)` | Schedules a registered host-side Python callable |
| `allocate_domain(name, workers, window_size, buffers=[...])` | Context manager returning a handle indexed by domain-local rank |
| `malloc(worker_id, size) -> int` | **Argument order is `(worker_id, size)`** — the reverse of `Worker.malloc(size, worker_id=0)` |

## Callables and task args

```python
CoreCallable.build(signature=[ArgDirection...], binary=kernel_bytes)

ChipCallable.build(
    signature=[ArgDirection...],
    func_name="my_orchestration",     # the exported orchestration symbol
    binary=orch_bytes,
    children=[(func_id, core_callable), ...],
)
```

`ArgDirection` is `SCALAR`, `IN`, `OUT`, or `INOUT`. The signature list is
positional and defines the task-arg order. `func_id` must match the id the
orchestration submits. `ChipCallable` exposes `binary_size`.

```python
args = ChipStorageTaskArgs()
args.add_tensor(ChipTensor.make(dev_ptr, (rows, cols), DataType.FLOAT32))
```

Tensors are added **in signature order**. `ChipTensor.make(data_ptr, shape, dtype)`
takes a device pointer; `DataType` carries the element types.

## `CallConfig`

`CallConfig()` defaults are fine for an ordinary run.

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- | ------- |
| `aicpu_thread_num` | `0` | AICPU threads for this run; `0` selects the architecture default |
| `enable_chip_swimlane` | `0` | `0` off; `1`–`4` select detail. L2 only |
| `enable_dump_args` | `0` | Capture per-task arguments |
| `enable_pmu` | `0` | `0` off; `>0` selects the event type |
| `enable_dep_gen` | `0` | Emit the dependency graph |
| `enable_scope_stats` | `0` | Writes `<output_prefix>/scope_stats/scope_stats.jsonl` |
| `output_prefix` | `""` | **Required whenever any diagnostic is enabled** |
| `runtime_env` | — | `ring_task_window`, `ring_heap`, `ring_dep_pool`; `tensormap_and_ringbuffer` only |

`validate()` runs at every submit/run entry point and throws if a diagnostic is
on without `output_prefix`, or if a ring override breaks the ring's constraints.

## `simpler_setup`

Compilation and test scaffolding. Exported from the package root:

| Name | Use |
| ---- | --- |
| `KernelCompiler` | `compile_incore(source_path, core_type, pto_isa_root, extra_include_dirs)`, `compile_orchestration(runtime_name, source_path)`, `get_orchestration_include_dirs(runtime)` |
| `ensure_pto_isa_root()` | Clones/updates the pinned pto-isa checkout and returns its path |
| `extract_text_section(binary)` | Required on hardware platforms before wrapping a kernel `.o` |
| `scene_test(level, runtime)` / `SceneTestCase` | The decorator and base class for declarative examples and tests |
| `Tensor`, `Scalar`, `TaskArgsBuilder`, `CallableNamespace` | Scene-test arg construction |
| `make_chip_tensor_arg`, `torch_dtype_to_datatype` | torch interop |
| `parse_platform` | Platform string parsing |
| `RuntimeBuilder` | Runtime build orchestration |

Analysis CLIs live under `simpler_setup.tools`; see
[command-line flags and tools](cli.md).
