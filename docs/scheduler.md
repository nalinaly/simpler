# Scheduler — DAG Dispatch Internals

The Scheduler is the single-threaded DAG executor for one hierarchical
`Worker`. The Orchestrator constructs slots and dependencies; the Scheduler
dispatches READY slots, processes worker completions, releases downstream
dependencies, and retires terminal slots.

See [orchestrator.md](orchestrator.md) for submission and dependency inference,
and [worker-manager.md](worker-manager.md) for endpoint execution.

## 1. Queue topology

The final queue layout separates directed NEXT_LEVEL work from freely
scheduled SUB work:

```text
NextLevelReadyQueues
├── group FIFO
└── stable worker id -> single-task FIFO

ReadyQueue
└── shared SUB FIFO

Scheduler
└── completion FIFO
```

`Orchestrator::enqueue_ready` is the only READY router:

```text
NEXT_LEVEL single -> next_level.single[target_worker_id]
NEXT_LEVEL group  -> next_level.group
SUB               -> ready_sub
```

Both immediately-ready submissions and dependency-released consumers use
this function. A directed task therefore cannot re-enter a shared
NEXT_LEVEL queue after waiting in PENDING.

Each `ReadyQueue` is a mutex-protected non-blocking FIFO, partitioned by run:
a task is enqueued under its own `run_id`, and the Scheduler pops only from the
partition of the run that currently holds the FIFO head. That is what keeps two
admitted runs from interleaving their device work while both are live.

Root submission, run activation, stop requests, a worker publishing itself
idle, and group-member completions that do not enqueue a terminal task
completion all advance a wake generation under the Scheduler
condition-variable mutex. Terminal task completions push the completion FIFO
under the same mutex. The wait predicate checks for a completion or an
unconsumed wake generation.
Blocked queue heads therefore remain queued without keeping the predicate
permanently true. Ready queues have no blocking pop or shutdown state.

The predicate is edge-triggered, and that is a contract on everything that
feeds it: **any state change that turns already-queued work into placeable
work must push a completion or advance the generation.** The predicate no
longer re-reads queue occupancy or worker state, so a change that only mutates
those is invisible to a parked Scheduler.

Two producers are easy to miss because neither pushes a completion.
`dispatch_ready` re-queues work it could not place — through
`enqueue_ready_cb`, which by design does not notify — so the retry depends
entirely on a later edge. And an endpoint lane publishes its completion *before*
it publishes its lane state: it calls `on_complete` and only then decrements
`inflight_`. That order is deliberate, so a stopping Scheduler cannot read a
worker as no longer busy while its final completion is still unqueued — which
means the completion wake alone can land on a worker that still reads as
occupied, and the dispatch pass it triggers finds nothing placeable.

What makes the retry happen is that the Scheduler does not park while any lane
is busy: the wait on `completion_cv_` is taken only when
`WorkerManager::any_busy()` is false. A lane that is still occupied therefore
gets another progress round and another dispatch pass without needing an edge
at all, and the edge-triggered predicate governs only the genuinely idle case.

Popping a slot is not the same as owning it. A run whose graph callback throws
fails and consumes its own unstarted slots, so the Scheduler claims each slot
with an atomic `READY -> RUNNING` compare-exchange at the moment it dispatches;
a lost claim means the cancelling path already owns that slot.

## 2. Scheduler loop

The Scheduler drains completions before dispatching new work:

```cpp
while (true) {
    wait_until_completion_or_new_wake_generation();

    while (completion_queue has an item) {
        on_task_complete(item);
    }

    reserved_workers = dispatch_next_level_group();
    dispatch_next_level_singles(reserved_workers);
    dispatch_sub_ready();

    if (stop_requested && all workers are idle) {
        drain final completions;
        dispatch one final pass;
        break;
    }
}
```

`loop_mutex` covers completion and dispatch slot access.
`Orchestrator::release_run` uses the same mutex during optional globally
quiescent compaction, preventing slot removal while the Scheduler holds a
reference.

## 3. Directed NEXT_LEVEL dispatch

### Single tasks

Every single task contains one exact stable `target_worker_id`. For each
registered NEXT_LEVEL worker, the Scheduler checks only that worker's FIFO:

```text
if target worker is idle and its FIFO is non-empty:
    pop FIFO head
    READY -> RUNNING
    dispatch to that exact worker
```

There is no idle-worker search, rebinding, work stealing, or scan into another
worker's queue. Outside a group-head reservation, each worker FIFO progresses
independently, so a busy worker A does not block READY work for worker B.

### Group tasks

A group is one DAG node with one exact stable worker ID per member. The
Scheduler examines only the group FIFO head:

```text
resolve every target worker
if every target is idle:
    pop the group
    initialize all member states
    READY -> RUNNING
    dispatch member i to target_worker_ids[i]
else:
    leave the group at the FIFO head
    reserve every target against single-task dispatch
```

Dispatch remains all-or-nothing: no group member launches until the complete
target set is idle. A blocked FIFO head reserves every target against new
single-task dispatch while existing work drains. Singles on other workers
continue normally, and later groups do not reserve workers because the
Scheduler does not scan past the FIFO head. The reservation is released when
the group launches.

A blocked head is structurally stalled when one of its reserved targets is
idle and that target's single FIFO is non-empty. If that state persists for
five seconds, the Scheduler emits one native warning for the episode with the
group slot, busy target IDs, idle-but-queued target IDs, and their single FIFO
head slots. A head change or disappearance of the structural condition starts
a new episode. The warning does not classify the state as a deadlock and does
not release the reservation.

## 4. SUB dispatch

SUB has no public worker-ID selection. All READY SUB tasks share one FIFO.
For a single task the Scheduler chooses any idle SUB worker. For a group it
chooses the required number of distinct idle SUB workers; if there are not
enough, it returns the task to the queue and stops that drain pass.

This is intentionally separate from NEXT_LEVEL placement. SUB free scheduling
does not provide a compatibility path for omitted NEXT_LEVEL targets.

## 5. Dependency release and PENDING updates

Submission records each live producer in the consumer's `fanin_count`. A
consumer with live producers enters PENDING and is not placed on a ready
queue. When a producer completes successfully, the Scheduler increments each
consumer's `fanin_released`:

```cpp
if (++consumer.fanin_released >= consumer.fanin_count) {
    if (CAS(consumer.state, PENDING, READY)) {
        enqueue_ready_cb(consumer_slot);
    }
}
```

The compare-and-swap ensures that exactly one producer completion performs
the PENDING-to-READY transition. The callback routes by the consumer's own
type and exact target, not by the producer.

If a producer fails, `poison_task` moves not-yet-running downstream consumers
to FAILED instead of READY. Poisoned tasks are never dispatched but still
release references and retire normally.

## 6. Completion and group aggregation

Each `WorkerThread` reports a `WorkerCompletion` containing the slot,
`group_index`, outcome, and error message. A single-task completion goes
directly to the Scheduler completion FIFO.

Group members update per-member terminal state under `group_mu`. Only when all
members are terminal does `worker_done` enqueue one aggregate completion for
the group slot. The first member failure determines the stored failure;
members already running finish, and not-yet-dispatched SUB members are marked
skipped. Directed NEXT_LEVEL groups are launched as a complete set.

On aggregate completion the Scheduler:

1. moves the slot to COMPLETED or FAILED;
2. releases or poisons downstream consumers;
3. releases references held on this task's producers;
4. calls `try_consume` when all fanout references are released.

The Orchestrator's consume callback erases TensorMap entries that still point
to the slot, releases its Ring storage, and decrements the active-task count.

## 7. Lifecycle and invariants

`Worker::init` registers and starts WorkerManager endpoints first, freezes the
stable NEXT_LEVEL worker-ID queue map, initializes the Orchestrator, and then
starts the Scheduler. `Scheduler::stop` requests termination, wakes the loop,
waits for workers to become idle, drains final completions, and joins its
thread.

The scheduling invariants are:

1. A NEXT_LEVEL slot always has exactly one target per member.
2. A NEXT_LEVEL single is present only in its target worker's FIFO.
3. A NEXT_LEVEL group is present only in the group FIFO and launches only on
   its complete target set.
4. SUB slots never carry target-worker metadata.
5. Only the Scheduler calls `WorkerThread::dispatch`.
6. Only one successful PENDING-to-READY transition enqueues a consumer.
7. A group produces one aggregate DAG completion regardless of member count.
8. A NEXT_LEVEL single does not wait for a not-yet-dispatched peer at the same
   scheduler level; work that requires concurrent placement is submitted as a
   group.
