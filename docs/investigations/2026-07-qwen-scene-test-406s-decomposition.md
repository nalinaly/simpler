# Why qwen3_14b_decode held a device for 406 s — and the four answers that were wrong

**Date**: 2026-07-30
**Verdict**: root cause found (torch thread oversubscription in goldens, fixed in
[#1601](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/simpler/pull/1601)); golden caching,
golden vectorisation, and a nightly golden split all considered and dropped

## Question

`qwen3_14b_decode` was the one scene test excluded from the general a2a3 sweep.
`ci.yml` carried a `HEAVY_IGNORE="--ignore=.../qwen3_14b_decode"` plus a step of
its own with a 1800 s session budget, on the grounds that at "~5 min" it would
eat more than half the sweep's 600 s budget — the budget that makes the sweep a
hang detector.

The case is an ordinary `@scene_test(level=2)` class. Nothing about it is
structurally special, so the question was where its time actually went, and
whether the exclusion could be removed rather than managed.

The intuition a future contributor will reach for is the one that misled this
investigation four times over: **the expensive thing must be the big thing.**
The case has a 38 GiB fixture, 40 fused layers, 36 kernels including a
template-heavy vendor tree, and a 40-layer host reference. Every one of those is
a plausible culprit and only one of them was right.

## What was tried

### Separating queue wait from work

Wall-clock per step comes from the Actions API; it does **not** distinguish
waiting for a device from using one. The `npu-lock` lines in the job log do:

```bash
gh api "repos/hw-native-sys/simpler/actions/jobs/<JOB_ID>" \
  --jq '.steps[] | "\(.name)\t\(.started_at)\t\(.completed_at)"'

gh run view --repo hw-native-sys/simpler --job <JOB_ID> --log \
  | grep -E '\[npu-lock\]|task_[0-9]{8}_'
```

`task-submit` localises its messages, so match on the ASCII parts. Submission
carries a `task_<date>_<id>` token. The three `[npu-lock]` line shapes are
distinguishable without reading the words:

| Line ends with | Meaning |
| -------------- | ------- |
| `)...` | the wait for that device started |
| `(pid=NNNN)` | the lock was granted |
| neither | the locks were released |

Queue time is submission to the first `pid=`; card-held time is that `pid=` to
the release. Note the log fetch goes to
`productionresultssa10.blob.core.windows.net`, which this box's whitelist proxy
rejects with 403 — unset `HTTPS_PROXY` for that call.

### Timing the host phases off-device

`generate_inputs` and `compute_golden` are pure torch and need neither CANN nor
a device; `simpler_setup` imports with `sys.path` pointing at the source tree:

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "python"); sys.path.insert(0, ".")
from simpler_setup.goldens import qwen3_14b_decode as Q
args = Q.generate_inputs(1234, 3500)      # fixture
Q.compute_golden(args)                    # 40-layer reference
```

### Timing compilation per source

`KernelCompiler` needs only `PTO_ISA_ROOT` and CANN's `ccec` — no built runtime,
no device. The vendor CCE kernels additionally need the `_CANN_INCLUDE_DIRS`
list the test builds from `$ASCEND_HOME_PATH`; without them they fail on
`'basic_api/kernel_basic_intf.h' file not found` and silently drop out of any
total.

```bash
export PTO_ISA_ROOT=<repo>/build/pto-isa
source /usr/local/Ascend/cann/set_env.sh
```

## Result

### The job, and the case inside it

`st-onboard-a2a3`, ci run 30507320146, job 90761014912 — 2297 s total:

| Where the job's 2297 s went | Wall | Share |
| --------------------------- | ---- | ----- |
| **queued waiting for dies** (8 separate `task-submit` acquisitions) | **1187 s** | **52%** |
| holding a device | 1005 s | 44% |
| checkout, venv, `pip install '.[test]'` | ~105 s | 5% |

The sweep's first acquisition alone waited **976 s** for four free dies. Of the
eight acquisitions, the five trailing smoke steps spent 210 s re-queueing for
75 s of work.

`qwen3_14b_decode` held a device for **406 s**, decomposed by measuring each
phase separately on the same class of box (320 cores):

| Phase | Wall | Needs a device? |
| ----- | ---- | --------------- |
| kernel compilation — 36 incores + 1 orchestration | 59 s | no |
| `generate_inputs`, the 38 GiB fixture | 13 s | no |
| **`compute_golden`, 40 layers** | **359 s** | **no** |
| host→device upload, device run, comparison | remainder | yes — device busy for **tens of ms** |
| | ~431 s measured vs 406 s in CI (6%) | |

Compilation breaks down as ~1.1–1.3 s per ordinary incore, 6.6 s for the
orchestration, and 8.4 s for the vendor FAI kernel's AIV variant (1330 KiB) —
the single outlier.

### Post-cache lock boundary

Local a2a3 validation of the #1604 persistent compile cache on 2026-08-03 used
the same `StressBatch16Seq3500` case and split the invocation at the CI lock
boundary:

| Phase | Wall | Device lock |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| cold `scene_test_compile` warm-up (37 compilation units) | 75.24 s | not held |
| `task-submit` invocation after warm-up | 53.87 s | held after allocation |
| device `runner_run.device_wall` marker inside that invocation | 35.416 ms | held |

The cache artifact was written before `task-submit`, remained unchanged during
the device run, and the case passed. This confirms that compilation no longer
consumes card time. Fixture construction and golden computation still execute
inside the locked pytest process; moving them would require a same-job data
handoff or a delayed-lock interface rather than the long-lived golden cache
rejected below.

### The root cause

None of the golden's 359 s was arithmetic. Its reference walks **3584 small
slice operations per layer**, and torch sizes its intra-op pool from the core
count, so on a many-core host every one of those calls forks and joins hundreds
of threads to move a few KiB:

| torch threads | per layer |
| ------------- | --------- |
| 320 (default = `nproc`) | 6.35 s |
| 64 | 1.31 s |
| 16 | 1.13 s |
| 8 | 1.07 s |
| 4 | 1.05 s |
| 2 | 1.59 s |
| 1 | 1.82 s |

Five to eight times the cost of the work, flat from 4 to 16, turning back up
below 4. Nothing in `simpler_setup/`, `conftest.py` or the workflows had ever
set a thread count, and all three goldens under `simpler_setup/goldens/` are
built from per-tile Python loops — qwen is merely the densest (8 `for`-range
loops against 2 each), so every golden was paying this on every many-core host.

Capping to 8 around the two `compute_golden` call sites takes the golden to
~38–43 s and the case to ~115 s. The results are unaffected: the same fixture
golden-computed at 320 and at 8 threads is **bit-identical** across `out`,
`k_cache` and `v_cache` (`torch.equal` true) — worth checking rather than
assuming, since thread count can reorder float reductions.

### The four wrong answers

Each was plausible, each was killed by a specific measurement. They are recorded
because the next person will reach for them in the same order.

| Hypothesis | What killed it |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| The 38 GiB fixture dominates | `generate_inputs` is **13 s**. The 38 GiB is `torch.cat([w] * 40)` replication of one layer's weights, so only ~2 GB is ever generated; the rest is memcpy. |
| Kernel compilation dominates | **59 s** measured per source. Real, and now the largest remaining term, but never the majority. |
| Per-case process/worker startup dominates | The floor is real — `test_hello_worker` (`Worker.init()` + `close()`, no kernels) is 4.1 s, and the eleven allreduce collectives take 17.9–20.6 s each despite exercising five different algorithms, which does say fixed overhead. But 57 cases summing to 615 s cannot explain a 1482 s step. |
| The 320-thread golden figure is an artifact of this box | Half true and the most instructive error. The README reported "~49 s golden", which matches a 4–16-thread host, so the 359 s looked like a local artifact and was retracted. It was not: summing the independently measured phases (59 + 13 + 359 = 431) against the 406 s CI window closes to 6%, which only works if CI's golden is also the slow one. Both numbers were real; they differ by thread count, and the README's had never described CI. |

An earlier hypothesis — that the unexplained time was device contention — was
correct in general and wrong for this case: contention is 52% of the *job*, but
qwen's own acquisition waited 0 s because it asks for a single die.

## Why not (now)

Four fixes were considered and dropped once the thread curve was measured.

**Caching the golden.** Deterministic from `(seed, seq_len)`, and the payload is
small — decode writes one token per sequence per layer, so `out` plus the
touched KV slots is ~2.8 MB against a 14 GiB pool. Dropped: with the cap the
golden costs ~40 s, which does not justify a cache key that must hash the
reference implementation's own source. A key over inputs alone goes stale
silently when `_one_layer` changes and then confirms a wrong device result —
worse than no cache.

**Vectorising the gather.** The 3584 slice operations per layer could be one
`index_select` over `block_table`. Dropped: the cap already removes 85% of the
cost without touching a reference implementation whose readability is the point,
and it fixes the other two goldens at the same time.

**Splitting the golden to a nightly workflow.** Implemented, then reverted
before merge. Dropped: it moved ~40 s of work at the cost of a workflow with no
owner — a red nightly has no PR to attach to, so `discipline.md` §5 does not
reach it — and it put the only check that 40 layers compose correctly (per-layer
indexing into the stacked weights, per-layer KV pool offsets; no smaller test
covers either) on a 24-hour delay with a full day of merges to bisect.

**`skip_golden` on the case in CI.** Dropped for the same coverage reason,
without the nightly's compensation: the 40-layer dispatch would keep running
with nothing checking it was right.

## When to reconsider

- **The cap value.** 8 is a middle of a flat 4–16 range measured on a 320-core
  aarch64 host with torch 2.7.1+cpu. If goldens grow tiles large enough that
  their per-op work stops being dwarfed by pool overhead, re-measure the curve
  before assuming 8 still fits.
- **Golden caching or vectorisation.** Worth re-opening only if a golden's
  post-cap cost becomes a material share of its case again — say, if a future
  case's reference exceeds a couple of minutes with the cap in place.
- **Compilation.** It is now the largest term in the case (59 s of ~115 s) and
  has no cross-run cache: `_compile_cache` is a module-level dict cleared at
  session end, so every CI run recompiles every kernel. The key machinery
  already exists (`l3_compile_cache_key()` composes a stable key) and only ever
  reaches an in-memory dict. Tracked with the device-lock question in
  [#1604](https://github.com/hw-native-sys/simpler/issues/1604).
- **The device lock.** The #1604 warm-up keeps kernel compilation outside
  `task-submit`; fixture construction and golden computation remain inside the
  locked pytest process. Moving those phases requires a same-job handoff or a
  delayed-lock interface. It still pulls against the competing idea of holding
  **one** lock for the whole job, which would reclaim the 210 s of re-queueing
  but lengthen the hold.
