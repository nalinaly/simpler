"""Simpler unified logging — one Python threshold propagated to C++.

The public ladder is DEBUG / INFO / TIMING / WARN / ERROR. TIMING sits between
INFO and WARN and is the default so stable performance markers remain visible
without enabling ordinary INFO traffic. NUL is a suppression sentinel.

`Worker.init()` snapshots the effective ``simpler`` logger threshold and
forwards it to `ChipWorker.init()` once. The Python wrapper seeds the
process-wide HostLogger before the C++ side loads host_runtime.so; onboard
setup maps the same threshold onto CANN's coarser severity ladder.
