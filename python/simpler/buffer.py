"""Owner/consumer side of the Buffer ABI.

The three wire types — ``CanonicalIdentity``, ``BufferDescriptor`` and ``Tensor`` — are the C++
structs of ``buffer.h`` bound directly, so there is one definition of the layout and one validator
(``validate_tensor``) behind every boundary that builds or decodes one. This module re-exports them
and adds what is inherently host-side: ``Buffer``, which owns a POSIX shm, the constructors that wrap
a backing as one, and ``ImportRegistry``, the consumer's map-once cache. Transporting a ``Tensor``
is the TaskArgs mailbox blob's job and lives in ``task_args.h``, not here.

``CanonicalIdentity`` is fixed-length (opaque ``owner_instance_id`` + ``buffer_id`` + ``generation``)
so hashing and comparison cannot read past it whatever arrives on the wire. The owning worker's tree
path is **not** part of the identity: it is interned to a diagnostic ``owner_worker_path_id`` whose
side table lives only in the owning process.

    ``BufferDescriptor`` has no field that distinguishes sibling chips (``owner_worker_id`` is
    host-side-only free/copy provenance, never serialized). A DEVICE backing minted for chip 0
    of such a Worker therefore also passes this check on sibling chip 1. It still rejects a
    *different* Worker's device buffer, and any host endpoint outright. The exact-chip half of
    the endpoint x address_space matrix is enforced at submit time by the
    ``(target_worker_id, ptr)`` check in ``orchestrator.py``; this is a backstop for a path that
    reaches ``materialize`` without going through it, not a replacement for that check.

    ``materialize()``'s DEVICE-backing rejections are tagged with
    ``RegionAccessReasonCode.UNSUPPORTED_ENDPOINT_RELATION`` (``comm_endpoints.py``) — the same
    reason code the domain-scoped ``EndpointRegistry``/``RegionAccessService`` capability engine
    reports for the same question at region-planning time. The two mechanisms share only this
    rejection vocabulary, not a live registry object: this context is built inside forked child
    processes (and at L2's same-process lazy-materialize point), both of which run before
    ``EndpointRegistry.from_snapshot()``'s ``_require_ready_for_region_planning()`` precondition
    can be assumed to hold. ``EndpointRegistry``'s topology snapshot also carries no per-chip
    identity (only per-Worker), so it could not close this class's own Worker-grained-not-chip-
    grained limit even where it is reachable.
