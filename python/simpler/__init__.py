"""Simpler runtime — public Python surface.

Host-side log filter setup happens in `ChipWorker.init` (see
`simpler.task_interface`): it `ctypes.CDLL`s libsimpler_log.so RTLD_GLOBAL,
calls its `simpler_log_init` C entry to seed the process-wide HostLogger, then
hands off to the C++ `_ChipWorker.init` which dlopens host_runtime.so (whose
`simpler_init` reads CANN dlog config off that same HostLogger, onboard only).
The level forwarded is a one-shot snapshot of the `simpler` Python logger.
Nothing log-related needs to happen at import time here.

`Worker` and the `task_interface` submodule resolve on first attribute access
rather than at import time: both pull in the `_task_interface` extension, so
eager imports here would make `import simpler` fail wherever that extension is
missing or stale, including for callers that only want the logging helpers.
